> These packages aren't yet published on npm. This is still highly experimental.
> Need to figure out a few things before releasing the first version:

> - Move to a Github Organization

Cloudy is a set of constructs for the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) that aim to improve the DX by providing a faster and type-safe code environment.

## Design Goals

- Use ESM modules along with a subset of TypeScript that doesn't generate code and can be striped away. This will come in handy if the [Type Annotations Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations) gets accepted.
- Consistency with the AWS CDK constructs: offer the same API for constructs, but enhanced with types
- Consistency with the AWS SDK v3: offer the same API for clients, but enhanced with types

## Example

### Publishing typed messages on a topic using an inline lambda function

```ts
import * as cdk from "aws-cdk-lib";
import * as cloudy from "@cloudy-ts/cdk";
import { SNSClient, PublishCommand } from "@cloudy-ts/client-sns";

const app = new cdk.App();

const stack = new cdk.Stack(app, "cloudy-playground");

const topic = new cloudy.aws_sns.Topic(stack, "topic", {
  messageType: cloudy.ValueType.as<"Hello" | "World!">(),
});

const sns = new SNSClient({});
const publishMessage = new cloudy.aws_lambda.Function(stack, "publishMessage", {
  async handler() {
    await sns.send(
      new PublishCommand({
        TopicArn: topic.topicArn,
        Message: "Hello",
      }),
    );
    await sns.send(
      new PublishCommand({
        TopicArn: topic.topicArn,
        Message: "World!",
      }),
    );
  },
});
topic.grantPublish(publishMessage);
```

## Further improvements

The idea of this project is to leverage the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) typing system and provide type-enhanced CDK constructs such as `cloudy.aws_sns.Topic`, `cloudy.aws_sqs.Queue`, `cloudy.aws_dynamodb.Table`, etc. as well as type-enhanced [AWS SDK v3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/index.html) client. In conjunction, it would allow a supreme developer experience.
