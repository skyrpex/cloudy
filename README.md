Cloudy is a set of constructs for the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) that aim to improve the DX by providing a faster and type-safe code environment.

## Design Goals

- Use ESM modules along with a subset of TypeScript that doesn't generate code and can be striped away. This will come in handy if the [Type Annotations Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations) gets accepted.
- Consistency with the AWS CDK constructs: offer the same API for constructs, but enhanced with types
- Consistency with the AWS SDK v3: offer the same API for clients, but enhanced with types

## Example

You can check out a list of examples in the [examples/src](examples/src) directory.

### Publishing typed messages on a topic using a callback lambda function

```ts
import * as cdk from "cloudy-cdk-lib";
import { SNSClient, PublishCommand } from "cloudy-cdk-lib/client-sns";

const app = new cdk.App();
const stack = new cdk.Stack(app, "cloudy-example");

const topic = new cdk.aws_sns.Topic(stack, "Topic", {
  // Cloudy allows you to restrict the SNS Topic message types. In this
  // example, we will only allow messages with either "hello" or "world!".
  messageType: cdk.ValueType.string<"hello" | "world!">(),
});

const sns = new SNSClient({});
const publishMessage = new cdk.aws_lambda.CallbackFunction(
  stack,
  "PublishMessage",
  {
    async handler() {
      await sns.send(
        new PublishCommand({
          TopicArn: topic.topicArn,
          // If you try writing a different message, you'll get a type error.
          Message: "hello",
        }),
      );
    },
  },
);
topic.grantPublish(publishMessage);
```

## Further improvements

The idea of this project is to leverage the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) typing system and provide type-enhanced CDK constructs such as `cloudy.aws_sns.Topic`, `cloudy.aws_sqs.Queue`, `cloudy.aws_dynamodb.Table`, etc. as well as type-enhanced [AWS SDK v3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/index.html) client. In conjunction, it would allow a supreme developer experience.
