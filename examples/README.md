Here you can try some example stacks.

## Deploying Examples

Just go to the example directory you want to run, and execute the cdk CLI:

```sh
# Deploy example 1:
cd examples/src/1-hello-world
pnpx cdk deploy
```

Don't forget to delete your stack after you're done. You can do that with:

```sh
pnpx cdk destroy
```
